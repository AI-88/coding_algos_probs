// In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

// Write a function that tells you how many guesses it took to find a number in the primes array using the binary search algorithm.

// Return -1 if a number is NOT in the primes array.

const primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97];

const binarySearch = (arr, n) => {
  // finish the function
  return arr;
};

binarySearch(primes, 43); // should return '4' guesses;
binarySearch(primes, 41); // should return '1' guess;
